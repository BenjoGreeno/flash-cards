      "question": "What is a Load Balancer?",
      "answer": "A system that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed"

      "question": "What is database sharding?",
      "answer": "Partitioning a database horizontally across multiple servers, where each shard contains a subset of the data"

      "question": "What is caching and why is it important for scalability?",
      "answer": "Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage (memory) to reduce database load and improve response times"

      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the difference between stateful and stateless applications?",
      "answer": "Stateless apps don't store user session data on the server (easier to scale), while stateful apps maintain session state"
